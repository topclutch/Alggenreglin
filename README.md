# üß¨ Genetic Algorithm for Data Mining / Regression

This project implements a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to solve **data mining problems**, such as:  
- Feature selection  
- Linear and non-linear regression model fitting  
- Hyperparameter optimization  

It includes scripts to prepare data, execute the genetic algorithm, and evaluate the results.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Modular implementation** of a Genetic Algorithm (GA)  
- Representation of **individuals (chromosomes)** for regression and/or feature selection problems  
- Genetic operators: **selection**, **crossover**, **mutation**, and **replacement**  
- Evaluation using metrics such as `MSE`, `RMSE`, and `R¬≤`  
- Support for experimentation with different parameters: population size, number of generations, mutation rate, etc.
